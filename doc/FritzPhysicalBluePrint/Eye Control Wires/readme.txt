This directory contains .pdf files that show mechanical drawings
for how to make the control wires for Fritz.

These parts can be made using 0.032" diameter music wire.  Bends
can be made by hand using needle nose pliars.  A digital caliper
will be highly useful in making measurements prior to making bends.

There are 2 each of the horizontal and vertical wires.  There
are 4 each of the eyelid wires.
