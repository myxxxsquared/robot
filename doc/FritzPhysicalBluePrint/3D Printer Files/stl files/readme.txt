Open source release 1.0

Date: 5/31/2013

This directory contains .stl format files for Fritz, the robotic head.

There are 2 versions of the eyelid.  One with buttresses, which is a built
in support. The other is the straight .stl file.  Users can use this 
to make their own supports, or have their machine autogenerate supports.  
Supports will be needed with this part.

All other .stl file parts do not need supports.
