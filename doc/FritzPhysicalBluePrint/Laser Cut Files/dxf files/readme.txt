Open source release 1.0

Date: 5/31/2013

This directory contains .dxf format files exported from solidworks.
These files can be used to import into a program to do laser cutting
of the parts for Fritz.

Note that parts that are repeated (occur more than once in a Fritz)
have a "_2x" in the filename to signal to you that you need more 
than one.
